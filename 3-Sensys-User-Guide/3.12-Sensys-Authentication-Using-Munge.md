Munge is recommend to be used to provide authentication between orcm daemons and orcm tools. Munge library is covered by LGPL, and the Installation guidelines can be found at:  http://dun.github.io/munge/
The recommend version of installation is version 0.5.1:  https://github.com/dun/munge/releases/tag/munge-0.5.11
## USAGE:
The following configurations should be performed to use munge.

1. The munge.key should be created as per the steps mentioned in "Installation Guide": https://github.com/dun/munge/wiki/Installation-Guide
2. Munge key should be distributed on every node which runs orcmd/octl tool and needs authentication.
3. The system admin will create a group manually in "/etc/group" and add all the users recommend to run the orcmd daemons (on the compute node) to this group.
4. The orcmd should be started with mca-parameter "```--omca sec munge```" to enable authentication.
5. Orcmd should be started with another mca-parameter "```--omca sec sec_munge_authorize_group=<name_of_authorized_group> ```" for authorization.
## EXAMPLE:
In this example, the goal is to run orcmd as user "admin" and authorize remote users with a group called "orcmusers".
1. Create a group called "orcmusers".
    * ```groupadd orcmusers```
2. Add users to the group by using one of the below commands.
    * ```usermod -a -G orcmusers admin``` (this command is to add existing user "admin" to existing group "orcmusers".
    * ```useradd -G orcmusers admin``` (this command is to create new user "admin" and add to group "orcmusers").
3. Make sure that munged is running on the local machine.
    * Check with ps command if "/usr/sbin/munged" is running. Expectation is that munged is using munge.key that is same as the key on other nodes that will try to connect to it. munge key is usually installed in default location "/etc/munge/munge.key"
4. Make sure that time is synchronized on all the nodes that are using munge.
    * Preferred method is to sync time using ntp.
5. Start orcmd with command:
```
        orcmd --omca sec munge --omca sec_munge_authorize_group=orcmusers
```

Once this daemon starts running with this configuration, it will accept connections only from remote connections which have munge enabled in the similar way, and use the exact same munge.key, and running as a user who belongs to the user group "orcmusers" to establish a successful connection. Thus the authentication and authorization are achieved.
Similar to orcmd, orcmsched daemon can be started with munge enabled, and octl can be started with same parameters to use munge authentication to connection to orcmsched.
