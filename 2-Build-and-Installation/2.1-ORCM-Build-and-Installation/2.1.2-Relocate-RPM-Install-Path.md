To install rpm and to relocate the binaries to a different folder, run the following command as root.
```
shell$ rpm -ivh open-rcm-0.5.0gitrc1.rpm --relocate /opt/open-rcm=/home/<user>/orcm
```
This will relocate the rpm from /opt/open-rcm to /home/<user>/orcm folder.
Background: ORCM hard-codes some directory paths in its executables based on installation paths specified by the configure script. For example, if you configure with an installation prefix of /opt/open-rcm/, ORCM encodes in its executables that it should be able to find its help files in /opt/open-rcm/share/orcm. 
The "installdirs" functionality in ORCM lets you change any of these hard-coded directory paths at run time (assuming that you have already adjusted your PATH and/or LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables to the new location where Open MPI now resides). 
Move an existing ORCM installation to a new prefix: Set the OPAL_PREFIX environment variable before launching ORCM. For example, if ORCM had initially been installed to /opt/open-rcm and the entire orcm tree was later moved to /home/<user>/orcm, setting OPAL_PREFIX to /home/<user>/orcm will enable ORCM to function properly. Also, set the OPAL_LIBDIR to point to the /home/<user>/orcm/lib64 folder for loading the dynamic components or plugins.
