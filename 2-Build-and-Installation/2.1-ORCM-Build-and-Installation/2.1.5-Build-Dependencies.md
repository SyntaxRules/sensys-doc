####2.1.1.1 GNU Build Tools

Following GNU build tools minimum versions are requirement for configuring and building ORCM from the github development repo:

* autoconf: 2.69 from https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/
* automake: 1.12.2 from http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/
* libtool:  2.4.2 from https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/

It is recommended to download and install the .tar.gz file of each, untar and run the following:
```
./configure –prefix <install_folder>/usr
make
make install
```

####2.1.1.2 Dependencies for sensor framework IPMI component

IPMI Util – IPMI util library is a dependency for including IPMI plugin in the sensor framework.  IPMI Util libraries is for accessing Base board management controller (BMC) on compute nodes and for collecting OOB RAS monitoring data from the compute nodes. Aggregator node will need this installed for OOB access to the compute node BMC’s.

Download the 2.9.3 release of IPMI Util library from here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/ipmiutil/files/ipmiutil-2.9.3.tar.gz
    
Following github repo contains a version of IPMI Util library with several patches to the issues found in the IPMU Util library: https://github.com/vpedabal/ipmiutil_orcm.git
```
git clone https://github.com/vpedabal/ipmiutil_orcm.git
cd ipmiutil_orcm
./beforeconf.sh 
./configure --libdir=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
make -j 8
make install
```

####2.1.1.3 Database Dependencies

ODBC driver and database schema are optional for logging the RAS monitoring data to the database (mysql, postgres).

mysql or postgres – optional database servers for data logging.

See the database user guide for installing and configuring database.

####2.1.1.4 Other Dependencies

Install lmsensor, SIGAR and ODBC drivers.

#####2.1.1.4.1 RHEL

```
shell$ yum install lm_sensors  
shell$ sensors-detect  # detect the sensors and add to your list. (It should detect coretemp sensor)

shell$ yum install sigar
shell$ yum install sigar-devel
 
shell$ yum install unixODBC
shell$ yum install unixODBC-devel
```

#####2.1.1.4.2 Ubuntu

```
shell$ apt-get install libssl-dev

shell$ apt-get install lm-sensors
sensors-detect  # detect the sensors and add to your list. (It should detect coretemp sensor)
              
shell$ apt-get install unixodbc-dev unixodbc-bin unixodbc

shell$ git clone https://github.com/hyperic/sigar.git
shell$ cd sigar
shell$ ./autogen.sh
shell$ ./configure
shell$ make
shell$ make install
```
