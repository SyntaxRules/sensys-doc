The ‘orun’ tool provides user interface to launch jobs on an existing allocation or a new allocation request with the scheduler, this becomes a convenience utility for a session request with a single job definition.  If specified within an allocation, this utility invokes next job to be run within the session.  This can be done in both interactive or as commands in a batch script. 

For interactive job launch, the ‘orun’ tool provides a blocking call to submit new allocation requests to the scheduler and upon successful allocation launches jobs in one shot.

For batch job launch, the ’osub’ tool is used for submitting batch jobs.  This tool submits the batch script along with the session allocation request to the scheduler. Upon successful allocation scheduler sends the batch script to the session head node process (HNP) daemon, and the HNP daemon executes the script. The batch script should contain the embedded orun calls launching applications on the allocated session.

The ‘orun’ tool command line options are described below:
```
orun [OPTION]...  [PROGRAM]...
```

To run a user application with a new allocation request following is the syntax:
```
shell$ orun [-np <X>] [--node <N>] <program>
```

Example:
```
shell$ orun –np 4 –node 4 hostname
```

This will allocate N nodes with a blocking request to the scheduler and runs X copies of <program> in the new allocation. The ‘np’ option will default to running all X copies on in a round-robin fashion by allocated nodes. The orun tool will send the name of the directory where it was invoked on the local node to each of the remote nodes, and attempt to change to that directory.

To run a user application with already allocated session following is the syntax:
```
shell$ orun [-np <X>] [--hnp-uri <uri-name>] <program>
```

Example:
```
shell$ orun –np 4 –hnp-uri  “65536.0;tcp://<hnp-ipaddrs> :12345” hostname
```

This will use the existing allocation and spawn the job by sending it to the session HNP and session HNP inturn will map the application process to the allocated nodes.

The following are the options for _orun_:

* `-am <file list>`: Specify an aggregate MCA parameter set file list.
* `--app <app. file>`: Provide an application file.  This will ignore all other command-line options.
* `-d | -debug | --debug`: Enable debugging of Open RTE.
* `-debug-daemons | --debug-daemons`: Enable debugging of any Open RTE daemons used by the application.
* `-debug-daemons-file | --debug-daemons-file`: Same as the previous option, but stores the output in files.
* `-gomca | --gomca <name> <value>`: Pass global MCA parameters that will apply to all contexts, where `<name>` is the parameter name and `<value>` is the parameter value.
* `-h | --help`: Print the _orun_ help text.
* `-hnp-uri | --hnp-uri <URI>`: Provide the URI for the HNP node.
* `--map-by <policy>`: Specify the mapping policy to use for allocating processes.  The policy may be: `slot`, `hwthread`, `core`, `socket` (default), `numa`, `board`, `node`.
* `-n | --np <n>`: Specify the number of processes to run.
* `-omca | --omca <name> <value>`: Pass context-specific MCA parameters, where `<name>` is the parameter name and `<value>` is the parameter value.  They are considered global if `--gomca` is not used and only one context is specified.
* `-path | --path <path>`: Provide a path for looking for executables to start processes.
* `-V | --version`: Print the tool version.
* `-xml | --xml`: Request output in XML format.

The following options are related to allocation requests sent to the scheduler:

* `--account <name>`: Provide an account to be charged.
* `--gid <ID>`: Provide a group ID to associate to the session.
* `--max-node <n>`: Specify the maximum number of nodes allowed in the allocation.
* `--min-node <n>`: Specify the minimum number of nodes required for the allocation.
* `--node <n>`: Same as `--min-node`.
* `--project <name>`: Provide a user-assigned project name.
