The _orun_ tool provides the user an interface to launch jobs, either on an existing allocation or a new allocation (in which case the allocation request is sent to the scheduler together with the job launch request).  The latter becomes a convenience utility for session requests with a single job definition.  When called with an allocation, _orun_ will invoke the next job to be run within the session (this can be done when _orun_ is invoked separately or as part of a batch job).  When requesting a new allocation, the tool performs a blocking request to the scheduler, and upon obtaining a successful allocation, it launches the job in one shot.  The following diagrams depict this scenario.

As mentioned previously, _orun_ can be invoked within a batch job.  For batch jobs, the _osub_ tool may be used by providing it a batch script.  This tool submits the batch script along with the session allocation request to the scheduler, and upon successful allocation, the scheduler sends the batch script to the session "shepherd" daemon, which then executes the script.  The batch script should contain the embedded _orun_ calls for launching applications on the allocated session.

The usage for the _orun_ tool is as follows:
```
orun [OPTION]...  [PROGRAM]...
```

To run a user application with a new allocation request, use the following syntax:
```
orun [--np <X>] [--node <N>] <program>
```

Example:
```
% orun -–np 4 –-node 4 hostname
```

This will allocate 4 nodes with a blocking request to the scheduler (as a new allocation will be requested), and will run 4 copies of _hostname_ in the newly created allocation. The `np` option will default to running all copies of the program in a round-robin fashion by allocated nodes. The _orun_ tool will send the name of the directory where it was invoked on the local node to each of the remote nodes and attempt to change to that directory.

To run a user application with an already allocated session, use the following syntax:
```
orun [--np <X>] [--hnp-uri <URI>] <program>
```

Example:
```
osub --node <N> -i
orcmshell%env |grep -i hnp
        ORCM_MCA_HNP_URI=65536.0;tcp://<hnp-ipaddrs>:12345
orcmshell% orun -–np 4 –-hnp-uri  “65536.0;tcp://<hnp-ipaddrs> :12345” hostname
```

This will use the existing allocation that was specified and spawn the job by sending it to the session "shepherd" daemon.  The session "shepherd" daemon will in turn map the application process to the allocated nodes.

The following are the options for _orun_:

* `--am <file list>`: Specify an aggregate MCA parameter set file list.
* `--app <app. file>`: Provide an application file that contains a list of applications to be executed.  Entries are provided one per line and they should include any command-line parameters that need to be passed to the executable.  This will ignore all other command-line options.
* `-d | --debug`: Enable debugging of Open RTE.
* `--gomca <name> <value>`: Pass global MCA parameters that will apply to all contexts, where `<name>` is the parameter name and `<value>` is the parameter value.
* `-h | --help`: Print the _orun_ help text.
* `--hnp-uri <URI>`: Provide the URI for the "shepherd" node.
* `--map-by <policy>`: Specify the mapping policy to use for allocating processes.  The policy may be: `slot`, `hwthread`, `core`, `socket` (default), `numa`, `board`, `node`.
* `-n | --np <n>`: Specify the number of processes to run.
* `--omca <name> <value>`: Pass context-specific MCA parameters, where `<name>` is the parameter name and `<value>` is the parameter value.  They are considered global if `--gomca` is not used and only one context is specified.
* `--path <path>`: Provide a path for looking for executables to start processes.
* `-V | --version`: Print the tool version.
* `--xml`: Request output in XML format.

The following options are related to allocation requests sent to the scheduler:

* `--account <name>`: Provide an account to be charged.
* `--gid <ID>`: Provide a group ID to associate to the session.
* `--max-node <n>`: Specify the maximum number of nodes allowed in the allocation.
* `--min-node <n>`: Specify the minimum number of nodes required for the allocation.
* `--node <n>`: Same as `--min-node`.
* `--project <name>`: Provide a user-assigned project name.
