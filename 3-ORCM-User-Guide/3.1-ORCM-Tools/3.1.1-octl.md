Admin-focused tool for interacting with ORCM.  This tool has the ability to run as an interactive shell or as a single one-shot command.  Currently the tool provides information about configured resources, sessions, and queues.  The tool is also for managing sessions and power budget at the admin level. 


The octl command itself takes the following options:
```
Usage: octl [OPTIONS]
  Open Resilient Cluster Manager "octl" Tool

   -am <arg0>            Aggregate MCA parameter set file list
   -gomca|--gomca <arg0> <arg1>  
                         Pass global MCA parameters that are applicable to
                         all contexts (arg0 is the parameter name; arg1 is
                         the parameter value)
-h|--help                This help message
   -omca|--omca <arg0> <arg1>  
                         Pass context-specific MCA parameters; they are
                         considered global if --gomca is not used and only
                         one context is specified (arg0 is the parameter
                         name; arg1 is the parameter value)
   -tune <arg0>          Application profile options file list
-v|--verbose             Be Verbose
-V|--version             Show version information

Interactive shell:
Use 'quit' or 'exit' - for exiting the shell
Use '<tab>' or '<?>' for help
```

The subcommands have the option to take arguments specific to that command as well.

####3.1.1.1 Interactive CLI
The interactive mode of the CLI is invoked by running the command without any subcommands.  Optional arguments such as MCA parameters can be specified as well.

```
% octl
*** WELCOME TO OCTL ***
 Possible commands:
   resource             Resource Information
   queue                Queue Information
   session              Session Management
   diag                 Diagnostics
   sensor               sensor    
   power                Global Power Policy
   analytics            Analytics information
   quit/exit            Exit the shell
octl> 
```

Once in the interactive shell, the `<tab>` key can be used to either autocomplete unambiguous partial commands or list possible completions for ambiguous partial commands.  The `<?>` key will display more information about all of the commands at the current hierarchy.

For example, pressing `<tab>` after entering `res` will autocomplete the `resource` command, and pressing `<tab>` after the `resource` command is fully entered, will show:
```
octl> resource 
	status add remove drain resume
octl> resource
```

As another example, pressing `<?>` after entering `queue`, will show:
```
octl> queue    
Possible commands:
   status               Queue Status
   policy               Queue Policies
   define               Queue Definintion
   add                  Add Resource to Queue
   remove               Remove Resource from Queue
   acl                  Queue Access Control
   priority             Queue Priority Modification

octl> queue
```

Notice how in both cases, control is returned to the user to complete the command as desired.

To exit interactive mode type 'quit' or 'exit' from the command prompt.

In the following sections, examples for each command will be given using normal one-shot execution mode.  However, they can also be executed in interactive mode.

####3.1.1.2 Resource
The resource command set is used to display information about the resources (nodes) configured in the system.  Currently resource modification is not supported administratively, but once support for that is added, the functionality will be invoked with this command set.  The current implementation displays the node connection state: either up(U), down(D), or unknown(?) and the job state: allocated or unallocated.  The node specification is an ORCM node regex.

Example:
```
% octl resource status
TOTAL NODES : 10
NODES                : STATE  SCHED_STATE
-----------------------------------------
node001              : U      UNALLOCATED
node[3:2-10]         : ?            UNDEF
```

####3.1.1.3 Queue
The queue command set displays information about the currently configured queues as well as the sessions within each queue.  The current scheduler defines 3 queues: running, hold, and default.  All sessions get placed initially in the default queue.  As the scheduler launches the sessions they will be placed on the running queue.  And a session that tries to allocate invalid resource definitions will be placed on the hold queue with a string describing the error.

The session information displays:

&lt;session-id&gt; &lt;userid|grouid&gt; &lt;number of nodes requested&gt; &lt;EXclusve or SHared&gt; &lt;Batch or Interactive&gt;

Example:
```
% octl queue status
********
QUEUES
********
running (1 sessions)
----------
1	502|20	1	EX	B	
hold (0 sessions)
----------
default (2 sessions)
----------
2	502|20	5	SH	B	
3	502|20	2	EX	B	
```

####3.1.1.4 Session
The session command set is used to modify submitted sessions.  Currently the only modification supported is canceling the session.  If the session is in the default queue waiting to run, canceling the session will remove it from the queue.  If the session is running, then canceling the session will terminate the running jobs and end the session.  The session cancel command takes a session-id as a required argument.

Example:
```
% octl session cancel 1
Success
% octl queue status
********
QUEUES
********
running (0 sessions)
----------
hold (0 sessions)
----------
default (2 sessions)
----------
2	502|20	5	SH	B	
3	502|20	2	EX	B
```

####3.1.1.5 Diag
The diagnostic command set allows running diagnostics on remote ORCM daemons.  These commands require a node regex specification for determining which remote daemons to run on.  See the [3.3 ORCM Node Regular Expressions](3.3-ORCM-Regex) section for details on how
to construct the regex.

Example 1: run cpu diagnostics on node001 through node010
```
% octl diag cpu node[3:1-10]
Success
```

Example 1: run ethernet diagnostics on node001 through node010
```
% octl diag eth node[3:1-10]
Success
```

Example 1: run memory diagnostics on node001 through node010
```
% octl diag mem node[3:1-10]
Success
```

####3.1.1.6 Power
The power budget command set allows setting and retrieving a cluster-wide power budget.  This will only be enforced if the appropriate plugin or subsystems are in place to honor this request.  The power _set_ command takes a required argument of a numeric power budget (in Watts) for the system.  The power _get_ command displays the currently set budget.

Example 1: setting the power budget to 10000 Watts
```
% octl power set 10000
Success
```

Example 2: getting the current power budget
```
% octl power get
Current cluster power budget: 10000
```

####3.1.1.7 Analytics
The analytics command set allows the user to add/remove/get workflows from any management node on a cluster.

Example 1: Adding the workflow
	% octl analytics workflow add workflow.txt

After using the above command, user will be able to see the workflow_id on the console.

Example 2: Get the workflow
	% octl analytics workflow get <vpid>

Example 3: Remove the workflow
	% octl analytics workflow remove <vpid> <workflow_id>
