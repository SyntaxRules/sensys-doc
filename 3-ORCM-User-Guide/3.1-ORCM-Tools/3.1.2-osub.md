The _osub_ tool provides a user interface for requesting new sessions to the scheduler. This tool can also be used for submitting batch jobs along with the session request. Upon a successful submission, a session ID will be returned.

The following diagram shows the tool's flow for the interactive option (`osub -i`):

![](3-ORCM-User-Guide/3.1-ORCM-Tools/osub.png)

* Users submit an allocation request using the _osub_ tool with the interactive option.
* The _osub_ tool will submit the request to the scheduler for an allocation and will receive a session ID.
* The _osub_ interactive mode option will wait until the nodes get allocated.
* Session daemons are launched and a "VM ready" message is received from the "shepherd" daemon.

The _osub_ tool also opens a shell prompt for the user to launch jobs with the allocated nodes (the "shepherd" daemon contact information is already set in the environment). The user can launch their jobs in this shell using the _orun_ tool:

Step 1: the job launch tool reads the "shepherd" daemon's contact information from the environment and will continues to launch job processes by sending the job information to the session "shepherd" daemon. The job information includes: application name, application args, number of processes to execute and other environment settings for the application process. 
 
Step 2: Upon job completion the session daemons will report the status back to the session "shepherd" daemon and wait for the command to terminate or launch additional processes. 

Step 3: When the user exits the shell prompt, a cancel command is sent to the session "shepherd" daemon, which in turn will send a final "job complete and terminate" command to all the session daemons and exit.

The usage for the _osub_ tool is as follows:
```
osub [OPTION]...
```

To submit a new allocation request, use the following syntax:
```
osub [--node <N>]  [-i]
```

Example:
```
% osub -n 4
```
This will send an allocation request (non-blocking) to the scheduler for 4 nodes and report the session ID back to the caller.

Example:
```
% osub â€“n 4  -i
```
This will send an allocation request (blocking) to the scheduler for 4 nodes and wait for the allocation.  Upon allocation, it will open an interactive shell to allow the user to launch jobs using _orun_. The allocation will be released upon exiting the shell.

The following are the options for _osub_:

* `--account <name>`: Provide an account to be charged.
* `-am <file list>`: Specify an aggregate MCA parameter set file list.
* `-b | --batchrun <script>`: Provide a path to a batch script file containing the list of applications to run.
* `-c | --constraints <constraints>` (TBD): Specify resource constraints to be applied.  At the moment, this feature is not supported and will be supported in a future release.
* `-e | --exclusive`: Used to specify that allocated nodes should not be shared with other sessions.
* `-f | --nodefile <file>` (TBD): Specify the path to a file containing the list of names of the candidate nodes.  At the moment, this feature is not supported and will be supported in a future release.
* `--gid <ID>`: Provide a group ID to associate to the session.
* `-gomca | --gomca <name> <value>`: Pass global MCA parameters that will apply to all contexts, where `<name>` is the parameter name and `<value>` is the parameter value.
* `-h | --help`: Print the _orun_ help text.
* `-i | --interactive`: Request a interactive mode.
* `-omca | --omca <name> <value>`: Pass context-specific MCA parameters, where `<name>` is the parameter name and `<value>` is the parameter value.  They are considered global if `--gomca` is not used and only one context is specified.
* `-P | --max-pe <n>`: Specify the maximum number of processing elements (PEs) allowed in the allocation.
* `--max-node <n>`: Specify the maximum number of nodes allowed in the allocation.
* `--node <n>`: Specify the minimum number of nodes required for the allocation.
* `-p | --pe <n>`: Specify the minimum number of processing elements (PEs) required for the allocation.
* `--project <name>`: Provide a user-assigned project name.
* `-s | --start <time>` (TBD): Specify the desired date/time for the allocation.  At the moment this feature is not supported and the start time defaults to "now".  This feature will be supported in a future release.
* `-v | --verbose`: Request verbose output.
* `-w | --walltime <time>`: Specify the maximum execution time for the job.
