ORCM runtime daemons are root level resource manager daemons launched in all compute nodes and aggregator nodes during cluster boot up process. These daemons collect RAS monitoring data from the compute nodes and logs in to the database.

At startup, each node boots its own ORCMD. The daemon detects the local node inventory and reports it to the aggregator in an initial "I'm alive" message. The aggregator enters the inventory in the database, and forwards the "I'm alive" message to the scheduler so it can construct an in-memory map of the cluster (nodes + inventory).

The orcmd daemon running on each node collects the RAS monitoring data using the sensor framework and its components, these components are configurable by using MCA parameters during build time and runtime. 

The monitoring data collected from the compute nodes goes through a analytics framework for data reduction before gets stored in the database.

The ‘orcmd’ tool command line options are described below:
```
orcmd [OPTION]...
```

Following is an example to start the orcmd daemon using a configurable mca parameter:
```
shell$ orcmd –-omca sensor heartbeat,cpufreq,pwr,ipmi
```

The above will configure orcmd to select the following components for the sensor data collection: heartbeat, cpufreq, pwr and ipmi. The heartbeat module is method to send the periodically collected data to the aggregator, the time interval for data collection and reporting to the aggregator is another configurable parameter in the orcm configuration file.

orcmd options:

* `-h, --help`: Display help for this command
* `-v, --verbose`: Be verbose
* `-V, --version`: Print version number. If no other arguments are given, this will also cause orun to exit.
* `--omca <arg0> <arg1>`: Pass context-specific MCA parameters; they are considered global if only one context is specified (`arg0` is the parameter name; `arg1` is the parameter value)
