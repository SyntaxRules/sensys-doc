The ORCM scheduler daemon is a root level resource manager daemon which runs on the SMS (system management server) node  (or Head Node).

The ORCM scheduler is responsible for accepting submission requests, prioritizing the requests, and allocating resources once available to the next appropriate request.  The scheduler framework will allow for different scheduler plugins to be loaded for required functionality.

The scheduler framework must take requests from session submission utilities and prioritize resource allocation appropriately.  The scheduler framework is primarily used to prioritize access to resources.  This framework will need to interface with the resource management framework to get updated resource states and session completion information.

The SCD operation can be split into 5 stages:

* Session initialization
* Session schedule
* Session allocated
* Session active
* Session terminated

The initialization is called for all new requests to assign session id and queue the request based on priority and requested resources.

The schedule is called whenever there is a resource state change or a request queued.  These state changes open the possibility for the next session to be launched.

The session allocated routine is invoked when the scheduler finds a session that can be run on the available resources.  This allocated routine is responsible for informing the resource manager framework that the resources are allocated, and to make sure that the current session can get all required resources.

The session active routine is called once all resources are allocated to the given session.  The active routine is responsible for launching the initial job steps across the allocation.

The resource manager framework will notify the scheduler framework upon job completion/termination with the terminated routine.

The ‘orcmsched’ tool command line options are described below:
```
Usage: orcmsched [OPTIONS]
  Open Resilient Cluster Manager Scheduler

   -am <arg0>            Aggregate MCA parameter set file list
   --daemonize           Daemonize the scheduler into the background
-e|-exec-path|--exec-path <arg0>
                         The path of the given executables to be launched
                         through scheduler
   -gomca|--gomca <arg0> <arg1>
                         Pass global MCA parameters that are applicable to
                         all contexts (arg0 is the parameter name; arg1 is
                         the parameter value)
-h|--help                This help message
-l|-config-file|--config-file <arg0>
                         Logical group configuration file for this orcm
                         chain
   -omca|--omca <arg0> <arg1>
                         Pass context-specific MCA parameters; they are
                         considered global if --gomca is not used and only
                         one context is specified (arg0 is the parameter
                         name; arg1 is the parameter value)
   --spin                Have the scheduler spin until we can connect a
                         debugger to it
   -tune <arg0>          Application profile options file list
-V|--version             Print version and exit
```

Following is an example to start the orcmsched daemon using a configurable mca parameter:
```
shell$ orcmsched –-omca scd_base_verbose 10
```

The above will configure orcmsched to increase verbosity in the scheduler framework.

orcmsched options:

* `--omca <arg0> <arg1>`: Pass context-specific MCA parameters (`arg0` is the parameter name; `arg1` is the parameter value)
