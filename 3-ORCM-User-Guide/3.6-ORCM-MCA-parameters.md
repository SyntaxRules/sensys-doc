# General MCA Parameters
## sensor_limit_sample_rate
The goal of this MCA parameter is to limit the user from setting the excessive sample 
rates for each node. This would act as a protection mechanism for limiting excessive 
load sent to the aggregator node. If a daemon have sensors with sample rates off limits, 
those values would be adjusted to the limit value; on the other hand, if the sample rate 
is changed via octl, an error would be thrown whenever the user set sampling rates beyond 
the limits via CLI.
