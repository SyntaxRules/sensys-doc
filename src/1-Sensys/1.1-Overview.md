# Overview
The Sensor System (Sensys) evolved with different names in the past Gemeter and ORCM. The Sensys system provides resilient, scalable monitoring capability that tracked process resource utilization and node state-of-health, collecting all the data in a database for subsequent analysis.

The data flows uses logical hierarchy and did require introduction of an aggregator role. Aggregators absorb the data sent by other nodes and can either store the data in a database, analyze the data, or both. The objective of the aggregator is primarily to concentrate the database operations, thus minimizing the number of active connections to the database itself.

The Sensys software includes several runtime loadable plugins that monitor various metrics related to different features present in each node. These metrics range from sensor related 'tangible' information like temperature, voltage, power usage, etc. to non-tangible metrics related to OS parameters like, memory usage, disk usage, process information, etc.
