## System Environmental Data

The relevant tables for storing system environmental data are:

* `data_sample_raw`
* `data_sample`
* `data_item`
* `node`

System environmental data is usually collected periodically at a set interval (or sample rate).  For efficiency, the `data_sample_raw` table is meant to store this data as is.  On the other hand, the `data_sample`, `data_item` and `node` tables are meant to store the system environmental data in a normalized format.  This could be done either directly or as part of post processing.  The `data_sample` will contain the actual data that was collected, and each record will pertain to a node and a data item (e.g. core temperature, core frequency, etc.), hence the relationships between these tables.

At the moment, Sensys is only storing system environmental data to the `data_sample_raw` table.  Enabling the use of the other tables is a feature that may be added in a future release.  For now, post processing may be done manually via SQL.

## Inventory Data

The relevant tables for storing inventory data are:

* `node`
* `node_feature`
* `feature`

The `node` table only contains very basic data about a node.  A more detailed description of a node can be obtained from the `node_feature` table, as it is meant to store any features the node may have (e.g. number of cores, memory, processor speed, cache, etc.).

To keep track of FRU data and FRU changes, the following tables can be used:

* `fru_type`
* `fru`
* `maintenance_record`

At the moment, Sensys is not collecting FRU data, so these tables are not currently in use.

## Diagnostics Data

The relevant tables for storing diagnostics data are:

* `diag`: stores the different diagnostics that can be run on a node (composed of a diagnostic type and sub type)
* `diag_type`
* `diag_subtype`
* `diag_test`: stores an actual diagnostic run with its result
* `test_result`
* `diag_test_config`: stores details about the test parameters that were used for a diagnostics run

## Events

The relevant tables for storing events are:

* `event`
* `event_type`

At the moment, Sensys is not storing events to the database, so the event tables are not currently in use.
