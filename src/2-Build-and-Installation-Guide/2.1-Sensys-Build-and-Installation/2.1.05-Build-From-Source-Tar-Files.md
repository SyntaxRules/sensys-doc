Please review the sections on "Build Dependencies" and "Pre-build Configurations" before actually starting to build.

The recommended install route is to build and install from the source RPM.  However, you can build directly from the source tar file as well.

Download the the source tar files gzip or bzip and use 'tar xf' to extract the files.  It is recommended to always specify a prefix when building.  Platform files can be used for managing sets of options for targets.
```
shell$ tar xvfz sensys-<version>.tar.gz or
shell$ tar xvfj sensys-<version>.tar.bz2

shell$ cd sensys-<version>
shell$ ./configure [--prefix <install_folder>] \
                   [--with-platform=<platform-file>]
shell$ make all
```
Run as root to install the binaries if current user does not have write permissions to prefix directory
```
shell$ make install
```
By default the tar file based install will go into /usr/local/lib/ and /usr/local/bin/.

The RPM spec.in file stores the default configure switches that are used when building the source RPM and can be used as a reference when building from the tar file.  That file can be found here:

* [contrib/dist/linux/openrcm.spec.in](https://github.com/intel-ctrlsys/sensys/blob/master/contrib/dist/linux/openrcm.spec.in)

The recommended minimum settings when running configure on tar file based installs:

```
--prefix=/opt/sensys
--with-platform=contrib/platform/intel/hillsboro/orcm-linux
```

These are addtional configure options that also can be used but are not required:

```
--exec-prefix=/opt/sensys
--bindir=/opt/sensys/bin
--sbindir=/opt/sensys/sbin
--sysconfdir=/opt/sensys/etc
--datadir=/opt/sensys/share
--includedir=/opt/sensys/include
--libdir=/opt/sensys/lib
--libexecdir=/opt/sensys/lib
--localstatedir=/var
--sharedstatedir=/opt/sensys/com
--mandir=/opt/sensys/share/man
--infodir=/opt/sensys/share/info
```
