# Relocate RPM install path
To install rpm and to relocate the binaries to a different folder add the `--relocate` switch.  Run the following command as root.
```
$ rpm -ivh sensys-<version>.rpm --relocate /opt/sensys=<new location>
```
The following environment variables will need to be set to the new location:
```
export OPAL_PREFIX=<new_location>
export OPAL_LIBDIR=<new_location>/lib
export OPAL_DATADIR=<new_location>/share
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<new_location>/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PATH=<new_location>/bin:$PATH:
```
