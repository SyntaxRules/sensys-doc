# Build from SRPMS
**Note**: See 2.1.01-Build-Dependencies if you have not previously set up your system for running Sensys.

First make sure to have install and configure an enviroment to build RPM and rebuild SRPMs, if you have not already setup a .rpmmacros. For example,
```
$ echo "%_topdir $HOME/rpmbuild" >$HOME/.rpmmacros
```
Download the source rpms and run 'rpmbuild' command to build binary rpms for your system. For example,
```
$ rpmbuild --rebuild sensys-<version>.src.rpm
```
This will create the following folder in users home directory
```
/home/<user>/rpmbuild
SRPM
RPM
BUILD
BUILDROOT
SPEC
```
Install the rpm:
```
shell$ cd /home/<user>/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/
shell$ sudo rpm -ivh open-rcm-<version>.rpm
```
This will install Sensys into
```
/opt/sensys/
```
You may want to set your path:
```
PATH=/opt/sensys/bin:$PATH:
export PATH
```
