# Build From GitHub Repo

Please review the sections on [Build Dependencies](2-Build-and-Installation-Guide/2.1-Sensys-Build-and-Installation/2.1.01-Build-Dependencies.html) and [Pre-build Configurations](2-Build-and-Installation-Guide/2.1-Sensys-Build-and-Installation/2.1.02-Pre-build-Configuration.html) before actually starting to build.

The recommended install route is to build and install from the source RPM.  However, you can build directly from the GitHub repo as well.

Following GNU build tools minimum versions are requirement for configuring and building Sensys from the GitHub development repo.

* [autoconf: 2.69](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/)
* [automake: 1.12.2](http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/)
* [libtool:  2.4.2](https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/)

It is recommended to download and install the .tar.gz file of each, untar and run the following:
```
$ ./configure [--prefix <install_folder>]
$ make
```
Run the following as root user if current user does not have write permissions to install folder
```
$ make install
```
Building from repo also requires:
```
$ flex libnl libtool-ltdl m4 patch xz
```

Following are the steps for building sensys from the github repo. Before building create an account in the github. Clone the sensys repo from the github branch.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/intel-ctrlsys/sensys
- or -
$ git clone https://<username>@github.com/intel-ctrlsys/sensys

$ cd sensys
$ ./autogen.pl
$ mkdir build
```
Note: User can create the build folder where ever they want
```
$ cd build
$ ../configure \
  --with-platform=../contrib/platform/intel/hillsboro/orcm-linux \
  [--prefix=<install_folder>]
```

The file pointed to by `--with-platform=` holds a list of configure
options.  See `configure --help` for the full list of options.
```
$ make
```
Run the following as root user if current user does not have write permissions to install folder
```
% make install
```
This will install the files under `/usr/local` unless the optional (but recommended) prefix is used.

The RPM `spec.in` file stores the default configure switches that are used when building the source RPM and can be used as a reference when building directly from the GitHub repo.  That file can be found here:

* [contrib/dist/linux/openrcm.spec.in](https://github.com/intel-ctrlsys/sensys/blob/master/contrib/dist/linux/openrcm.spec.in)

The recommended minimum settings when running configure on GitHub based installs:

```
--prefix=/opt/sensys
--with-platform=contrib/platform/intel/hillsboro/orcm-linux
```

These are additional configure options that also can be used but are not required:

```
--exec-prefix=/opt/sensys
--bindir=/opt/sensys/bin
--sbindir=/opt/sensys/sbin
--sysconfdir=/opt/sensys/etc
--datadir=/opt/sensys/share
--includedir=/opt/sensys/include
--libdir=/opt/sensys/lib
--libexecdir=/opt/sensys/lib
--localstatedir=/var
--sharedstatedir=/opt/sensys/com
--mandir=/opt/sensys/share/man
--infodir=/opt/sensys/share/info
```
