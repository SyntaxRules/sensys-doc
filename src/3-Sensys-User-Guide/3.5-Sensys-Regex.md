# Sensys Regex

The Sensys node regex is specified when a set of nodes have a similar name  prefix.  The prefix is stripped and the numbering that follows is turned into a padding specification and hyphenated range,  comma  separated  list,  or combination of both.  The padding specification is the total number of digits including 0 padded digits.  The regex for a single  node is the full nodename.  For nodenames that have different padding, the full regex is a comma separated list of regex for each  similarly padded node range.

For example:
```
node001,node002 : node[3:1-2]

node1,node2 : node[1:1-2]

node1,node2,node3,node4 : node[1:1-4]

node009,node010 : node[3:9-10]

node9,node10 : node[1:9],node[2:10]

node001,node002,node003,abc001,abc002 : node[3:1-3],abc[3:1-2]
```
