# Contributing to the source code

Sensys membership guidelines are the same as for Open MPI.  The following are the types of membership:

* Members: have voting rights
* Contributors: collaborate with coding, testing and hosting services
* Partners: provide other services to Open MPI

Individual contributors need to sign an individual license before contributing.  For more information, see: [Contributing to Open MPI as an Individual](http://www.open-mpi.org/community/contribute/individual.php).

Alternatively, an organization can sign an organization-level agreement: [Contributing to Open MPI as an Organization](http://www.open-mpi.org/community/contribute/corporate.php).

Note: Open MPI membership is viewed as applying to the entire project (i.e. all software projects).  So it's not necessary to sign a different contribution agreement for Open MPI vs. Sensys.  Of course, this doesn't mean that every contributor automatically gets write access to every software project.  For Sensys, the project gatekeeper is in charge of granting write access to the repo.
