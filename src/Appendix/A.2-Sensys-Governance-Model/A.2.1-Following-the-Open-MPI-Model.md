The majority of open source projects are community maintained: the community drives implementation, fixes and releases.  Today, Open MPI is a community maintained project and Sensys is derived from it (Sensys leverages about 2/3 of Open MPI's source code).  The Sensys governance model is also derived from the Open MPI's model.  More details about this governance model are provided in the following sections, but also please see:

* [Open MPI Technical Guidelines](https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/wiki/TechnicalGuidelines)
