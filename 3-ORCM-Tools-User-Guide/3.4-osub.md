The ‘osub’ tool provides user interface for new session request with the scheduler. This tool can also be used for submitting batch jobs along with the session request. Upon successful submission a session id will be returned.

Following shows osub –i interactive option flow:

Users will submit an allocation request using an OSUB tool with interactive option. OSUB tool will submit the request to the scheduler for an allocation and will receive a sessionid. The OSUB interactive mode option will wait till the nodes gets allocated, session daemons are launched and a VM ready message is received from the HNP daemon.

OSUB tool also opens a shell prompt to the user to launch jobs with the allocated nodes and HNP contact information set in the environment. The user will launch their jobs in this shell using ORUN tool.

Step 1: Job launch tool reads the HNP contact information from the environment and will continue to launch job process by sending the job information to the session HNP daemon. The job information includes application name, application args, number of processes to execute and other environment settings for the application process. 
 
Step 2: Upon job completion the session daemons will report the status back to the session HNP daemon and waits for command to terminate or launch additional processes. 

Step 3: When user exits the shell prompt a cancel command is sent to the session HNP daemon in turn will send a final job complete and terminate command to all the session daemons and exits.

The ‘osub’ tool command line options are described below:
```
osub [OPTION]...
```

To submit a new allocation request following is the syntax:
```
shell$ osub [--node <N>]  [-i]
```

Examples:
```
shell$ osub -n 4
shell$ osub –n 4  -i
```

The first command will send an allocate request (non blocking) for 4 nodes to the scheduler and reports session id back to the caller.  The second command will send an allocate request (blocking) for 4 nodes to the scheduler and waits for the allocation, upon allocation will open an interactive shell to launch jobs using orun. The allocation will be released upon exiting the shell.

osub options:
