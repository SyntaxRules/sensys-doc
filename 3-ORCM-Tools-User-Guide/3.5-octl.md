##3.5 octl

Administrative controls.  Currently has session cancel command, but this functionality should be moved to user-based utility.

The ‘octl’ tool command line options are described below:
```
shell$ octl cancel <sessionid>
```

Example:
```
shell$ octl cancel 1
```

This will cancel the session with id 1, by sending a cancel request message to the scheduler.
