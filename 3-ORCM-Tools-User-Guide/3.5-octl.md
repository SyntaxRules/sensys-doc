# ORCM Admin CLI

Admin focused tool for interacting with ORCM.  This tool has the ability to run as an interactive shell or as a single one-shot command.  Currently the tools provides information about configured resources, sessions, and queues.  The tool is also for managing sessions and power budget at the admin level. 

## Interactive CLI
The interactive mode of the cli is invoked by running the command without any subcommands.  Optional arguments such as mca parameters can be specified as well.  Once in the interactive shell, the `<tab>` key can be used to either auto-complete unambiguous partial commands or list possible completions for ambiguous partial commands.  The `<?>` key will display more information about all of the commands at the current hierarchy.

`% octl`

   session              Session Management
   diag                 Diagnostics
   power                Power Budget

## Resource
The resource command set is used to display information about the resources (nodes) configured in the system.  Currently resource modification is not supported administratively, but once support for that is added the functionality will be invoked with this command set.  The current implementation displays the node connection state (either up or down) and the job state (allocated or unallocated).  The node specification is an orcm node regex.

`% octl resource status`
```
TOTAL NODES : 10
NODES                : STATE  SCHED_STATE
-----------------------------------------
node001              : â†‘      UNALLOCATED
node[3:2-10]         : ?            UNDEF
```
## Queue
The queues command set display information about the currently configured queues as well as the sessions within each queue.  The current internal scheduler defines 3 queues: running, hold, and default.  All sessions get placed initially in the default queue.  As the scheduler launches the sessions they will be placed on the running queue.  And session that tries to allocation invalid resource definitions will be placed on the hold queue with a string describing the error.

The session information displays:

&lt;session-id&gt; &lt;userid|grouid&gt; &lt;number of nodes requested&gt; &lt;EXclusve or SHared&gt; &lt;Batch or Interactive&gt;

`% octl queue status`
```
********
QUEUES
********
running (1 sessions)
----------
1	502|20	1	EX	B	
hold (0 sessions)
----------
default (2 sessions)
----------
2	502|20	5	SH	B	
3	502|20	2	EX	B	
```
## Session
The session command set is used to modify submitted sessions.  Currently the only modification supported is canceling the session.  If the sessions is in the default queue waiting to run, canceling the session will remove it from the queue.  If the session is running, then canceling the session will terminate the running jobs and end the session.  The session cancel command takes a session-id as a required argument.

`% octl session cancel 1`
```
Success
```
`% octl queue status`
```

```
## Power
The power budget command set allows setting of and retrieving a cluster-wide power budget.  This will only be enforced if the appropriate plugin or subsystems are in place to honor this request.  The power set command take a required argument of a numeric power budget (in Watts) for the system.  The power get command displays the currently set budget.

`% octl power set 10000`
```
Success
```
`% octl power get`
```
Current cluster power budget: 10000
