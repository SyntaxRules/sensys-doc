The ‘orun’ tool provides user interface to launch jobs on an existing allocation or a new allocation request with the scheduler, this becomes a convenience utility for a session request with a single job definition.  If specified within an allocation, this utility invokes next job to be run within the session.  This can be done in both interactive or as commands in a batch script. 

For interactive job launch, the ‘orun’ tool provides a blocking call to submit new allocation requests to the scheduler and upon successful allocation launches jobs in one shot.

For batch job launch, the ’osub’ tool is used for submitting batch jobs.  This tool submits the batch script along with the session allocation request to the scheduler. Upon successful allocation scheduler sends the batch script to the session head node process (HNP) daemon, and the HNP daemon executes the script. The batch script should contain the embedded orun calls launching applications on the allocated session.

The ‘orun’ tool command line options are described below:
```
orun [OPTION]...  [PROGRAM]...
```

To run a user application with a new allocation request following is the syntax:
```
shell$ orun [-np <X>] [--node <N>] <program>
```

Example:
```
shell$ orun –np 4 –node 4 hostname
```

This will allocate N nodes with a blocking request to the scheduler and runs X copies of <program> in the new allocation. The ‘np’ option will default to running all X copies on in a round-robin fashion by allocated nodes. The orun tool will send the name of the directory where it was invoked on the local node to each of the remote nodes, and attempt to change to that directory.

To run a user application with already allocated session following is the syntax:
```
shell$ orun [-np <X>] [--hnp-uri <uri-name>] <program>
```

Example:
```
shell$ orun –np 4 –hnp-uri  “65536.0;tcp://<hnp-ipaddrs> :12345” hostname
```

This will use the existing allocation and spawn the job by sending it to the session HNP and session HNP inturn will map the application process to the allocated nodes.

orun options:

* `<program>`: The program executable. This is identified as the first non-recognized argument to orun.
* `<args>`: Pass these run-time arguments to every new process. These must always be the last arguments to mpirun. If an app  context file is used, <args> will be ignored.
* `--app <arg0>`: Provide an appfile for the application to launch with arguments; ignore all other command line options for the application.
* `-np, --np <#>`: Number of processes to run. Run this many copies of the program on the given nodes. This option indicates that the specified file is an executable program and not an application context. If no value is provided for the number of copies to execute (i.e. neither the `-np` nor its synonyms are provided on the command line), this will return an error (without beginning execution of the application).
* `-N <#>`: Launch n processes per node on all allocated nodes.
* `--node <#>`: Minimum number of nodes required for a new allocation.
* `-hnp-uri, --hnp-uri <arg0>`: URI of the session HNP for an existing allocation. This is for launching or relaunching jobs on already allocated nodes.
* `-path, --path <arg0>`: PATH to be used to look for executables to start processes.
* `-h, --help`: Display help for this command
* `-v, --verbose`: Be verbose
* `-V, --version`: Print version number. If no other arguments are given, this will also cause orun to exit.
* `-d, -debug, --debug`: Enable debugging of OpenRTE
* `-debug-daemons, --debug-daemons`: Enable debugging of any OpenRTE daemons used by this application
* `-gmca, --gmca <arg0> <arg1>`: Pass global MCA parameters that are applicable to all contexts (`arg0` is the parameter name; `arg1` is the parameter value)
* `-mca, --mca <arg0> <arg1>`: Pass context-specific MCA parameters; they are considered global if only one context is specified (`arg0` is the parameter name; `arg1` is the parameter value)

Following are the additional options for new allocation request to scheduler:

* `--account <arg0>`: Account to be charged
* `--gid <arg0>`: Group id to run session under
* `--min-node <#>`: Minimum number of nodes required for a new allocation.
* `--max-node <#>`: Max nodes allowed in allocation.
* `--project <arg0>`: User assigned project name.
