* Start ‘orcmsched’ as root daemon on the SMS – system management server (or on a head node for small scale clusters)
```
shell$ cd <install folder>
ORCM Scheduler

shell$ ./orcmsched
[SMS-linux:96034] Sun Aug  3 23:39:11 2014: ORCM SCHEDULER [[0,0],0] started
```

* Start ‘orcmd’ as a root daemon on the aggregator nodes (in small size cluster aggregator can be part of head node).
```
shell$ ./orcmd  2>&1 | tee orcmd-log.txt
```

You should see output lines that include both general system information, and other lines that include temperature info; e.g:
```
shell$ ./orcmd
