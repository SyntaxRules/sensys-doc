Following are the steps for building ORCM from the github repo and the ORCM source tar file. Before building create an account in the github and login and create a fork of the ORCM branch master. Clone the ORCM repo from the github branch.

NOTE: If you are using the source tar ball from the download link skip the autogen step this is already included in the tar ball and start from configure step below:
```
shell$ git clone https://github.com/open-mpi/orcm or git clone https://<username>@github.com/open-mpi/orcm

shell$ cd orcm
shell$ ./autogen.pl
shell$ mkdir build
Note: User can create the build folder whereever they want 

shell$ cd build
shell$ ../configure --with-platform=../contrib/platform/intel/hillsboro/orcm-linux â€“-prefix=<install_folder>/usr

The file pointed to by --with-platform= holds a list of configure options. See "configure --help" for the full list of options
Other possible configure args:
--SIGAR=<PATH>
- use LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<> for runtime   

shell$ make
shell$ make install
This will install the files in the install folder <install_folder>/usr/bin
```
