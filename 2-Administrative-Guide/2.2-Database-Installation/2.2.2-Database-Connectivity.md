This section provides instructions to configure clients (e.g. an aggregator node) to connect to the ORCM DB.  This is required for clients that will need to communicate with the database (e.g. clients that need to run ORCM with the DB component enabled).

To complete the following steps, the following files are needed (found in the ORCM repository in the “contrib/database” directory):

* “psql_odbc_driver.ini”
* “orcmdb_psql.ini”

####2.2.2.2 Installation Overview

Configuring the clients for connecting to the database requires:

1. Installing an ODBC driver manager
2. Installing the ODBC driver for the desired DBMS
3. Configuring a DSN

####2.2.2.3 Configuring the Clients for ODBC Connectivity

Before installing the DBMS ODBC driver, it’s necessary to install the ODBC driver manager: unixODBC.  The unixODBC package provides the necessary functionality to allow clients to connect to a database via ODBC.  In addition, for developing and building applications that will use ODBC, the unixODBC development package is necessary.

After installing the unixODBC driver manager, execute the following command: `odbcinst –j`.  Note where unixODBC installed the configuration files for: drivers, system data sources and user data sources.  These files will be needed in the following sections.

Please refer to the [unixODBC](http://www.unixodbc.org/) web page for installation instructions.

NOTE: unixODBC already provides a driver for PostgreSQL.  However, it’s recommended to install the latest drivers provided by the respective vendors.

#####2.2.2.4 PostgreSQL Installation

1. Install the PostgresSQL ODBC driver
    * Please refer to the [PostgreSQL installation wiki](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides) for availability of a package for the ODBC driver.
    * Alternatively, the ODBC driver can be built from source
        * The source code can be downloaded from the [PostgresSQL downloads web page](http://www.postgresql.org/ftp/odbc/versions/src/)
        * Please refer to the installation instructions provided with the source code.  Usually, the steps are:
            * `./configure`
            * `make`
            * `sudo make install`
        * After completing the installation, note the directory where the driver (“.so” file) was installed
2. Register the PostgreSQL ODBC driver
    * Edit the “psql_odbc_driver.ini” file and fill in the required prameters:
        * Driver: specify the absolute path where the PostgrSQL ODBC driver (“.so” file) was installed
        * Execute the following command:
            * `odbcinst –i –d –f psql_odbc_driver.ini`
        * Open the ODBC driver configuration file and verify the driver was configured correctly
3. Configure a DSN to connect to the ORCM DB
    * NOTE: the DSN may be configured at the user level (visible only to the current user) or at the system level (visible to all users that log in to the machine).
    * Edit the “orcmdb_psql.ini” file and fill in the required parameters:
        * Driver: specify the exact name of the driver as configured in the ODBC driver configuration file
        * Server: specify the hostname or IP address of the server where the database was installed
    * Configure the DSN:
        * `odbcinst –i –s –f orcmdb_psql.ini –l`
        * NOTE:
            * This will configure the DSN at the system level (visible to all users)
            * To configure the DSN at the user level (visible only to the current user):
                * `odbcinst –i –s –f orcmdb_psql.ini –h`
    * Open the respective DSN configuration file to verify the DSN was configured correctly
4. Verify the installation
    * Use the _isql_ command-line utility provided by unixODBC to connect to the database:
        * `isql <name of the DSN that was configured> orcmuser <orcmuser’s password>`
    * Try executing an SQL command:
        * `select * from data_sample`
        * The table will most likely be empty, but the query should at least succeed
