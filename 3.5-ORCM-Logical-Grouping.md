# Logical Grouping

OCRM provide a service which allows one to associate to a tag any sequence of nodes.  Where it is enabled, this tag can then be used as a shortcut for that node sequence.

Currently ORCM octl facility provides and uses this service.

There are three ways to specify the logical groupings: batch mode, interactive mode and directly.  The batch and interactive mode both uses the same commands:

```

[octl] grouping add <tag> <regex>

[octl] grouping remove <tag> <regex>

[octl] grouping list <tag> <regex>

```

In the above, [octl] is used only for the batch mode; it is to be omitted in the interactive mode.  The \<tag\> is any valid text string; if white spaces are in <tag>, use quotes in order to prevent automatic splitting.  \<regex\> is an ORCM regex.
