# Logical Grouping

OCRM provide a service which allows one to associate to a tag any sequence of nodes.  Where it is enabled, this tag can then be used as a shortcut for that node sequence.

Logical grouping can be used with the following services provided by the ORCM octl facility:
```
= grouping
= sensor
```

Within the octl sensor service, in order to tell that a logical grouping is to be used instead of a node regex, one must specify the tag prepended by the $ character.  For example, assuming that abc is the tag to which we asscociated three nodes: n1,n2 and n3:
```
    abc <--> n1,n2,n3
```
Then one would use $abc in order to tell the octl sensor service that all three nodes (n1,n2,n3) are to be used.

There are three ways to specify the logical groupings: batch mode, interactive mode and directly.  The batch and interactive mode both uses the same commands:

```

[octl] grouping add <tag> <regex>

[octl] grouping remove <tag> <regex>

[octl] grouping list <tag> <regex>

```

In the above, [octl] is used only for the batch mode; it is to be omitted in the interactive mode.  The \<tag\> is any valid text string; if white spaces are in <tag>, use quotes in order to prevent automatic splitting.  \<regex\> is an ORCM regex.

The output from grouping list will be in the same format as the one used by the storage file.  Note that the form in which the data is stored in the file will always end up being the form used by the logical grouping facility, and not necessarily the one a user used when the user built the logical file.

Both the remove and list command support a wildcard represented by the character *. Replacing \<tag\> by * indicates that all \<tag\> are to be selected; similarly for \<regex\>.

The third way to specify a logical grouping is to edit directly the storage file used.  It can be found at the location
```
    <user install directory>/etc/orcm-logical_grouping.txt
```

The file is a text file in limited ASCII format.  The format is as follows:
```
= The acceptable text characters are ASCII characters inclusively from ASCII 33 to ASCII 126.  
= The character # (ASCII 35), if it is the first character of a line, causes the line to be ignored.
= A <tag> is a text string with acceptable ASCII characters.
= A <regex> is a comma separated list of regex specifying nodes:
    node[2:1-100],node201

= A pairing constitutes of a <tag> on its own line and of a <regex> on any lines immediately following that <tag>.
= The <tag> must not be preceded by white space characters.
= The start of any <regex> line must be one or more white spaces characters.
= All set of <regex> lines belonging to the same <tag> should be grouped together.
= Duplicated <tag> <node> pairing are not removed.
```
Here is an example of what a valid logical grouping file could look like:
```
# This is a comment
abc
 node1,node[2:5-10],node2,node[1:3-4]
xyz
 n1,n2,n3,n[1:4-5]
```
