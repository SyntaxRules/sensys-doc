The database is a key component for supporting the various applications of the cluster software stack.  So it is just as important to ORCM as it provides support for its system and resource management tasks by storing hardware inventory, system environmental data, RAS events (including error conditions) and job accounting data.  Furthermore, the data stored in the database may also be useful to other applications, for example: cluster monitoring, system diagnostics and operator interface.

Finally, the database is not meant to be just a repository for all the data.  It should provide an API to abstract some of the low-level data storage details and the schema to provide applications independence from the data layer, thus providing flexibility and making the database and application maintenance easier.
