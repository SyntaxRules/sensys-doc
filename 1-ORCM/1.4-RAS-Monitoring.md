RAS monitoring encompasses the collection of all metrics & sensor related data from each node. It is primarily implemented under the ‘sensor’ framework present under the orcm project. It contains several plugins that monitor various metrics related to different features present in each node. These metrics range from sensor related ‘tangible’ information like Temperature, Voltage, Power Usage, etc. to non-tangible metrics related to OS parameters like, Memory Usage, Disk Usage, Process information, file monitoring, etc.

The RAS Monitoring in ORCM relies on the the Aggregator-Compute_Node model. All the sensor components running in each compute node scan the system and record metrics and send it to the aggregator, which acts as a collector and filters the data to be logged onto the database. A single exception to this is the IPMI plugin - contrary to running in the compute nodes and collecting the data, it runs actively only in the aggregator node, and collects the remote BMC's sensor data by issuing IPMI-over-LAN commands.
