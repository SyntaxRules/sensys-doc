The RAS Monitoring in ORCM relies on the the Aggregator-Compute_Node model. Most of the RAS monitoring is implemented under the 'sensor' framework of the 'orcm' project.

The 'sensor' framework contains different components or 'plugins' which are used in gathering specific type of metrics from each compute node. All the sensor components running in each compute node scan the system and record metrics and send it to the aggregator, which acts as a collector and filters the data to be logged onto the database. A single exception to this is the IPMI plugin - contrary to running in the compute nodes and collecting the data, it runs actively only in the aggregator node, and collects the remote BMC's sensor data by issuing IPMI-over-LAN commands.
