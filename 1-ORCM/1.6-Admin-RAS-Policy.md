System admins can define what constitutes a RAS event, assign a priority to the event, and what info is to be included in the event report. This is to be given to the notifier framework, and we need to verify that the syslog component in that framework properly writes the result in a machine-readable format into the syslog. Event definitions must support level checks (both high and low) on a specific sensor with leaky-bucket data smoothing algorithm, for example, if M measurements are outside bounds in a time window.

A typical admin RAS event policy includes:
* Sensor name: coretemp and corefreq are supported as for now
* Threshold value: threshold boundary of sensor measurement 
* Threshold type: high or low
* Max count: maximum number of measurement are out of bounds in a defined time window 
* Time window: time window of the leaky bucket
* Severity: severity/priority of the RAS event that is triggered by the policy; severity level follows RFC 5424 syslog protocol  
* Notification mechanism: notification mechanism of the event, syslog or SMTP email

Example of coretemp policy as below:

    sensor_coretemp_threshold=100:hi:2:60:crit:syslog;70:lo:4:60:warn:syslog
  
Examples of event notification in Syslog as below:

* Mar 18 14:23:35 leo-dev1 OpenRTE Error Report:[22448]: [Wed Mar 18 14:23:35 2015#012][[0,0],1] SET EVENT : host: dev1 core 6 temperature 43.000000 °C, higher than threshold 40.000000 °C for 4 times in 30 seconds

* Mar 18 14:29:31 leo-dev1 OpenRTE Error Report:[22478]: [Wed Mar 18 14:29:31 2015#012][[0,0],1] SET EVENT : host: dev1 core 0 freq 3.326000 GHz, higher than threshold 3.000000 GHz for 4 times in 30 seconds

Users can pass RAS event policies as MCA parameters when ORCM daemon starts as below:

    orcmd --omca sensor heartbeat,coretemp --omca sensor_coretemp_policy 30:lo:3:60:crit:syslog,100:hi:2:60:crit:syslog

or

    orcmd --omca sensor heartbeat,freq --omca sensor_freq_policy 3.0:hi:3:60:crit:syslog

Admins can also use octl command line tool to view, add or update RAS event policies at the admin level. 

The octl policy command allows setting admin event policies on remote nodes. These commands require a node regex specification for determining which remote nodes to run on. See the 3.3 ORCM Node Regular Expressions section for details on how to construct the regex.

Example 1: show RAS event policies on node001

    % octl sensor get policy node001
    ORCM getting sensor policy from Node:node001
    Sensor     Threshold     Hi/Lo    Max_Count/Time_Window    Severity     Action
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    coretemp     30.000        Lo       3 in    60 seconds       WARN        syslog 
    coretemp    100.000        Hi       2 in    60 seconds      ALERT        syslog 
    corefreq      3.000        Hi       3 in    60 seconds       CRIT        syslog 

Example 2: set coretemp high critical admin policy on node001 through node010

    % octl sensor set policy node[3:1-10] coretemp 80 hi 3 30 crit syslog
    Success
