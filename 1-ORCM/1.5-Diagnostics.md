System level diagnostics will detect and report failures of critical resources, including memory, processors, network paths and I/O interface. The diagnostic routines will be capable of isolating hardware problems down to the Field Replaceable Unit (FRU) level in both the system and its peripheral equipment. ORCM diagnostics framework supplies a consistent set of APIs for invoking the desired diagnostics functionality, while hiding the complexity of the implementation.

Normally diagnostics can be launched by system admin via octl commands. Octl diag commands can invoke the desired diagnostic tests on specific node or a list of nodes. The actual diagnostic tests will be executed on compute node quietly. Once the diagnostic is completed, compute node will send result to the aggregator node, which logs the result into database. The diagnostic result logging feature is still under development.
