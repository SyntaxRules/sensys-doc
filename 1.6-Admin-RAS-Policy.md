System admins can define what constitutes a RAS event, assign a priority to the event, and what info is to be included in the event report. This is to be given to the notifier framework, and we need to verify that the syslog component in that framework properly writes the result in a machine-readable format into the syslog. Event definitions must support level checks (both high and low) on a single sensor. Additional analytics will be required in the future, so the method by which we set the base event configuration needs to be flexible.
