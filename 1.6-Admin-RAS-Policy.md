System admins can define what constitutes a RAS event, assign a priority to the event, and what info is to be included in the event report. This is to be given to the notifier framework, and we need to verify that the syslog component in that framework properly writes the result in a machine-readable format into the syslog. Event definitions must support level checks (both high and low) on a specific sensor with leaky-bucket data smoothing algorithm, for example, if M measurements are outside bounds in a time window.

A typical admin RAS event policy includes:
* Sensor name: coretemp and corefreq are supported as for now
* Threshold value: threshold boundary of sensor measurement 
* Threshold type: high or low
* Max count: maximum number of measurement are out of bounds in a defined time window 
* Time window: time window of the leaky bucket
* Severity: severity/priority of the RAS event that is triggered by the policy; severity level follows RFC 5424 syslog protocol  
* Notification mechanism: notification mechanism of the event, syslog or SMTP email

Example of coretemp policy as below:

    sensor_coretemp_threshold=100:hi:2:60:crit:syslog;70:lo:4:60:warn:syslog
  
Examples of event notification in Syslog as below:
