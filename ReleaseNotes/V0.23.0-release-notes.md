New Features
============

* Exception Events Handling:
  Ability to filter events, suppress repeats and max rates for a given priority, type, category of events
  Runtime configuring events to write into syslog
  Runtime configuration to initiate an external email alert upon events

* Analytics - Data reduction Algorithms:
  Report out-of-band sensor values across chassis/rack/row/system

* Data Storage Strategy: 
  Store Data by type environment data and exception data
  Store N samples of data or N minutes of date over a time window.

* Command Line Tool
  Report 'N' minutes for environment sensors data around an event
  Report captured events data from the database using the command line tool

* Performance Measurements
  OOB sensor data collection using IPMI and SNMP protocols must only be limited by OOB hardware agent and no overheads are added by the software collecting the data.


Open Issues
===========

* CFGI configuration file version 1.0 doesn't recognize tags starting with blank spaces/tabs/enter key
  Workaround is to use CFGI v3.0 configuration files

* The 'octl' tool crashes in a unique situation to query sensor data
  Limit your command name length sizes to NAME_MAX length

* The cluster root process 'orcmsched' accumulates memory after serving a failed query using OCTL

* The 'octl' tool query command fails to recognize sensor name with spaces between names example "core temp"


Security Advisory:
==================

The file snmp.conf used for connecting to network devices using SNMP 
protocol uses a plain text password field for SNMP version 3. Since the 
file contains a plain text password, the read and write permissions 
on this file should be restricted to authorised admin users.
