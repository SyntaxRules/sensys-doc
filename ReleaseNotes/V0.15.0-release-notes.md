New features:
=============

* Ability to define logical group of nodes, racks, rows in configuration file
* Limit against excessive sampling rate requests
* CLI interface to get a list of all available sensors

Open Issues:
============

* ORCM OPAL_PREFIX and LD_LIBRARY_PATH conflicts with openmpi
