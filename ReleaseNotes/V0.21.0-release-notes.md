  Collect power consumption information from network devices using SNMP
  protocol. (network devices like PDUs, Network Switches)
* Data Smoothing Algorithms
  Generate an alert when ECC-correctable error rate goes above a user
  specified threshold


Open Issues:
============

* Orcmd configuration is not issuing warnings for port numbers outside of valid rage [0-65536]
* Progress threads and CFGI 3.0 multiple AG support results in only one AG logging to the DB
* Spurious WARNING: there is already a transaction in progress message at orcmd startup


Security Advisory:
==================

The file snmp.conf used for connecting to network devices using SNMP 
protocol uses a plain text password field for SNMP version 3. Since the 
file contains a plain text password, the read and write permissions 
on this file should be restricted to authorised admin users.

=================================================

* 1.8 Store Only Events
