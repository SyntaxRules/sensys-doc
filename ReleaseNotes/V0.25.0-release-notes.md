New Features
============

* Performance and Scalability
  DB ingest of environment or usage data must only be limited by HW rates, e.g., cached disk write
  Scalable infrastructure and services support up to 2,000 CNs

* Command Line Tool
  Enable/Disable individual sensor per sensor plugin
  Enable/Disable Chassis Identification LED

* Exception Event Handling
  Invoke an arbitrary site-specific tools upon an event

* XML Configuration
  IPMI and SNMP XML configuration file


Open Issues
===========

* OCTL timeout feature introduced recently makes most sensor queries to the ORCM DB to fail
  Additional Note: This issue should be hard to reproduce, but due to the changes done around this bug, currently the query functionality in OCTL is non-functional

* Killing a compute node orcmd then bringing it back up with dmidata enabled causes aggregator to seg fault

* IPMI error output when no ipmi configuration is provided
  IPMI sensor now requires a IPMI config file with login credentials to BMC

* CFGI configuration file version 1.0 doesn't recognize tags starting with blank spaces/tabs/enter key
  Workaround is to use CFGI v3.0 configuration files

* The cluster root process 'orcmsched' accumulates memory after serving a failed query using OCTL
