This section provides instructions on how to set up the ORCM DB.  These instructions are meant to be executed on the server that will contain the database.  At the moment, ORCM provides support for PostgreSQL, so the following sections will provide instructions on how to set up the database using this DBMS.

To complete the following steps, the following file is needed: “orcmdb_psql.sql” (found in the ORCM repository in the “contrib/database” directory).

NOTE: the following instructions will use the following settings as reference, but the database administrator may choose to use different settings:

* Database instance name: _orcmdb_
* Database user: _orcmuser_

| PostgreSQL Server    | 9.3 or higher   | Yes  | Required on database server |

NOTE: Client may be installed on any machine for administrative tasks: testing the database connection,
data and schema management, etc.

####2.2.1.2 Installation Overview
At a high level, installing the database requires the following steps:

1. Installing the DBMS
2. Performing some configuration tasks (e.g. enabling remote access to the database)
3. Creating the database
4. Performing basic DBA tasks: creating users and roles

####2.2.1.3 Notes On User Privileges
For simplicity, the following steps provide instructions for creating a single database user with all the privileges.  However, it’s recommended to create roles and set privileges appropriately.  It’s up to the DBA to decide this and it will depend on the number of users that need to be managed and on organization policies.

General recommendations regarding users and privileges:

* A separate administrative user should be created and it should be used to create the database.
* Roles should be used to manage user privileges.  Administrative users should have all privileges on the database while regular users should be restricted (depending on the data they need to access for their tasks).
* The standard ORCM user should have the following privileges:
    * Select, insert, update and delete privileges on all tables
    * Execute privileges on all stored procedures

####2.2.1.4 Preparing the Server

#####2.2.1.4.1 PostgreSQL installation

1. Install the PostgreSQL server and client
    * Please refer to the PostgreSQL documentation for installation instructions
    * [PostgreSQL installation wiki](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides)
2. Verify the installation by starting the _postgresql_ service
    * `service postgresql start`
    * NOTE:
        * Depending on the version, before being able to start the service it may be necessary to execute:
            * `service postgresql initdb`
        * If desired, the service may be configured to start automatically:
            * `chkconfig postgresql on`
        * The actual name of the service may vary (e.g. “postgresql-9.3”)
        * These commands need to be run with administrative privileges
3. Enable external TCP connections to the _postgresql_ service
    * Make sure the firewall is configured to allow incoming connections to the _postgresql_ service port (5432 by default)
    * Enable client authentication
        * Edit the “pg_hba.conf” configuration file
            * The file location may vary depending on the installation package used
            * For example:
                * “/etc/postgresql/9.3/main”
                * “/var/lib/pgsql/9.3/data/”
        * The file contains detailed instructions on how to add authentication configuration options
        * At the very least, external connections should be allowed to the _orcmdb_ database
        * Recommendation: start with basic password authentication and try more secure configurations once this is working
    * Enable networking for PostgreSQL
        * Edit the “postgresql.conf” configuration file
        * Edit the following line to specify what IP addresses to listen on:
            * `listen_addresses = ‘<comma-separated list of addresses>’`
            * NOTE: use `‘*’` to specify all
4. Create _orcmuser_
    * Use the _createuser_ command as the default _postgres_ user:
        * `sudo –u postgres createuser –P orcmuser`
        * NOTE:
              * This command will prompt the user for a password.  Please choose a strong password.
              * To verify if the user was created successfully, execute `\du` from a _psql_ session.
5. Create the _orcmdb_ database
    * NOTE: this requires the database creation script found in ORCM: “orcmdb_psql.sql”
    * Create the database:
        * `sudo –u postgres createdb --owner orcmuser orcmdb`
    * Use the _psql_ tool to run the database creation script:
        * `psql --username=orcmuser --dbname=orcmdb --password –f orcmdb_psql.sql`
        * NOTE: depending on the authentication configuration in “pg_hba.conf” for local connections, the _orcmuser_ may not be allowed to execute this command.  There are two alternatives for handling this:
            * Enable password authentication for local connections (at least temporarily)
            * Execute this command remotely
6. Verify the installation
    * Make sure the database server is listening on a port
        * `netstat -plane |grep postmaster`
    * Connect to the database from a remote machine:
        * `psql –-host=<hostname or IP address> -–username=orcmuser –-dbname=orcmdb --password`
    * List the database’s tables:
        * `\dt`
        * Here are some of the tables that will be listed
            * data_item
            * data_sample
            * event
            * event_type
            * fru
            * fru_type
            * job
            * job_node
            * maintenance_record
            * node
       * See [4.3 ORCM DB Schema](4.3-ORCM-DB-Schema) for the DB schema diagrams
