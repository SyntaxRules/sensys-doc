This section provides instructions to configure the ORCM DB component to connect to the ORCM DB.  This is required for clients that will be running ORCM and need to communicate with the database (ORCM with the DB component enabled).

####2.2.3.1 Configuring the ORCM DB Component

Specifically, the DB component within the ORCM DB framework that needs to be configured, is the ODBC component.  The ODBC component requires the following MCA parameters to be defined:

* db_odbc_dsn: specify the DSN name configured in the previous section
* db_odbc_user: specify the user and password in the following format: <user>:<password>

These MCA parameters may be specified in:

* The “openmpi-mca-params.conf” file
* The “orcm-site.xml” file
* The command line via the ORCM “-mca” command-line parameter
