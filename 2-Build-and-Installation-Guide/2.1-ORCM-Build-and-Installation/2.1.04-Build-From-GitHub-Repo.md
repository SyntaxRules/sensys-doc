Following GNU build tools minimum versions are requirement for configuring and building ORCM from the github development repo. 

* autoconf: 2.69 from https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/
* automake: 1.12.2 from http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/
* libtool:  2.4.2 from https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/

It is recommended to download and install the .tar.gz file of each, untar and run the following:
```
shell$ ./configure [--prefix <install_folder>]
shell$ make
```
Run the following as root user if current user does not have write permissions to install folder
```
shell$ make install
```

Following are the steps for building ORCM from the github repo. Before building create an account in the github. Clone the ORCM repo from the github branch.
```
shell$ git clone https://github.com/open-mpi/orcm
-or- 
shell$ git clone https://<username>@github.com/open-mpi/orcm

shell$ cd orcm
shell$ ./autogen.pl
shell$ mkdir build  
      Note: User can create the build folder where ever they want 
shell$ cd build
shell$ ../configure \
        --with-platform=../contrib/platform/intel/hillsboro/orcm-linux \
        [--prefix=<install_folder>]
```

The file pointed to by <code>--with-platform=</code> holds a list of configure 
options.  See <code>configure --help</code> for the full list of options.
```
shell$ make
```
Run the following as root user if current user does not have write permissions to install folder
```
shell$ make install
```
This will install the files under <code>/usr/local</code> unless the optional (but recommended) prefix is used.
