We need to enable the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) and configure the IPMI libraries for some of the functionality under RAS monitoring. Especially to enable the "**ipmi**" plugin. Following are the instructions for setting up BMC in BIOS for compute nodes and service nodes (aggregator):

Enable BMC in BIOS, how to do this is specific to your BIOS.  Refer to your server manual for guidance.

These instructions work on our specific development machine:
```
In BIOS settings, go to Server Management tab:
1. Enable Plug & Play BMC Detection. 
2. Select BMC Lan Configuration
    * Select IP source as dynamic
    * Scroll down, select user Id, and select root
    * Enable User Status.
    * Select Password, and enter a password
```

Once BMC is enabled, you can optionally configure it within Linux using ipmitool:
```
for module in ipmi_devintf ipmi_si ipmi_msghandler; do
    /sbin/modprobe $module
done

ipmitool lan set 1 ipsrc static
ipmitool lan set 1 ipaddr <IP>
ipmitool lan set 1 netmask <NETMASK>
ipmitool lan set 1 defgw ipaddr <GATEWAY>
```

Check settings with:
```
ipmitool lan print 1
```

Setup user:
```
ipmitool user set name 2 <user>
ipmitool user set password 2 <password>
ipmitool channel setaccess 1 2 link=on ipmi=on callin=on privilege=4
ipmitool user enable 2
```

If users need to use the "coretemp" plug-in they need the following kernel module on all nodes:
```
sudo modprobe coretemp
```
If users need to use the "componentpower" plug-in they need the following for setting up MSR on compute nodes and aggregator nodes:
```
ls -la /dev/cpu/<cpu #>/msr
```
If the "msr" file is not present, please load MSR module by running:
```
sudo modprobe msr
```
If users need to use the "dmidata" plug-in they need the following for accessing DMI information:
```
ls -la /sys/firmware/dmi
```
If the "dmi" file is not present, please load the dmi-sysfs module by running:
```
sudo modprobe dmi-sysfs
```
