Following GNU build tools minimum versions are requirement for configuring and building ORCM from the github development repo. 

* autoconf: 2.69 from https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/
* automake: 1.12.2 from http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/
* libtool:  2.4.2 from https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/

It is recommended to download and install the .tar.gz file of each, untar and run the following:
```
shell$ ./configure [--prefix <install_folder>]
shell$ make
```
Run the following as root user
```
shell $make install
```

Following are the steps for building ORCM from the github repo. Before building create an account in the github. Clone the ORCM repo from the github branch.
```
shell$ git clone https://github.com/open-mpi/orcm or git clone https://<username>@github.com/open-mpi/orcm

 shell$ cd orcm
 shell$ ./autogen.pl
 shell$ mkdir build  
      Note: User can create the build folder where ever they want 
 shell$ cd build
 shell$ ../configure 
        --with-platform=../contrib/platform/intel/hillsboro/orcm-linux 
        [--prefix=<install_folder>]
```

The file pointed to by --with-platform= holds a list of configure 
options.  See configure --help for the full list of option,
     - Other possible configure args:
                --SIGAR=<PATH>
     - use LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<> for runtime   
```
shell$ make
```
Run the following as root user
```
shell$ make install
```
This will install the files in the install folder  <install_folder>/usr/bin
