To install rpm and to relocate the binaries to a different folder add the --relocate switch.  Run the following command as root.
```
shell$ rpm -ivh open-rcm-<version>.rpm --relocate /opt/open-rcm=<new location>
```
The following environment variables will need to be set to the new location:
```
OPAL_PREFIX=<new location>
OPAL_LIBDIR=<new_location>/lib64
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<new_location>/lib64:<new location>/lib64/openmpi:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:
export OPAL_PREFIX OPAL_LIBDIR LD_LIBRARY_PATH
PATH=<new location>/bin:$PATH:
export PATH
```
