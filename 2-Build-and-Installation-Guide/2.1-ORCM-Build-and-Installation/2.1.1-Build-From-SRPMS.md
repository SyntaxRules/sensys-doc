Note: See [[2.1.5-Build-Dependencies]] if you have not previously set up your system for running ORCM.

Download the source rpms and run 'rpmbuild' command to build binary rpms for your system. For example,

```
shell$ rpmbuild --rebuild open-rcm-&lt;version&gt;.src.rpm
```

This will create the following folder in users home directory
```
/home/<user>/rpmbuild
SRPM
RPM
BUILD
BUILDROOT
SPEC
```
To install from the binary rpm created by rpmbuild run the following command as root
```
shell$ cd /home/<user>/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/
shell$ sudo rpm -ivh open-rcm-<version>.rpm
```
This will install ORCM into /opt/open-rcm/&lt;version&gt;/.  For this example, the 0.5.0 ORCM binaries would be installed into
```
/opt/open-rcm/0.5.0/bin
```
