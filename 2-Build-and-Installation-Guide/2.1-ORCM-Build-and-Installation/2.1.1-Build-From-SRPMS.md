Download the source rpms and run 'rpmbuild' command to build binary rpms for your system. For example,
```
shell$ rpmbuild --rebuild open-rcm-0.5.0rc1.src.rpm
```
This will create the following folder in users home directory
```
/home/<user>/rpmbuild
SRPM
RPM
BUILD
BUILDROOT
SPEC
```
To install from the binary rpm created by rpmbuild run the following command as root
```
shell$ cd /home/<user>/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/
shell$ sudo rpm -ivh open-rcm-0.5.0rc1.rpm
```
This will install ORCM into /opt/open-rcm/&lt;version&gt;/.  For this example, the ORCM binaries would be installed into
```
/opt/open-rcm/0.5.0rc1/bin
```
