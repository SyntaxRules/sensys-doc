To install rpm and to relocate the binaries to a different folder add the --relocate switch.  Run the following command as root.
```
shell$ rpm -ivh openrcm-<version>.rpm \
           --relocate /opt/openrcm=<new location>
```
The following environment variables will need to be set to the new location:
```
export OPAL_PREFIX=<new location>
export OPAL_LIBDIR=<new_location>/lib64
export OPAL_DATADIR=<new_location>/share
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<new_location>/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PATH=<new location>/bin:$PATH:
```
