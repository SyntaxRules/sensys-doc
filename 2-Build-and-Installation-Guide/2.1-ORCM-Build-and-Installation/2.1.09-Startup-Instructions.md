### ORCM Systemd/SysV Init
#### Systemd starting ORCM
starting scheduler
```
% systemd start orcmsched
```
starting aggregator/daemon
```
% systemd start orcmd
```
#### Systemd stopping ORCM
stopping scheduler
```
% systemd stop orcmsched
```
stopping aggregator/daemon
```
% systemd stop orcmd
```
#### SysV Init starting ORCM
starting scheduler
```
% service orcmsched start
```
starting aggregator/daemon
```
% service orcmd start
```
#### SysV Init stopping ORCM
stopping scheduler
```
% service orcmsched stop
```
stopping aggregator/daemon
```
% service orcmd stop
```
#### Systemd/SysV Init configuration settings
Scheduler runtime settings can be changed in
```
/etc/sysconfig/orcmsched
```
Aggregator and Daemon runtime settings can be changed in
```
/etc/sysconfig/orcmd
```

### Manual Head Node (HN) and Compute Node (CN) Setup


Set up your shared library path and executable path to point to the ORCM install.  This will be needed on all nodes.
```
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/open-rcm/<version>/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
PATH=/opt/open-rcm/<version>/bin:$PATH:
export PATH
```

* Start ‘orcmsched’ as root daemon on the SMS – 
system management server (or on a head node for small scale clusters)

ORCM Scheduler
```
shell$ orcmsched
[SMS-linux:96034] Sun Aug  3 23:39:11 2014: ORCM SCHEDULER [[0,0],0] started
```

* Start ‘orcmd’ as a root daemon on the aggregator nodes 
(on a small size cluster, aggregator can run on head node alongside scheduler).
```
shell$ orcmd 2>&1 | tee orcmd-log.txt
```

You should see output lines that include both general system information, and other lines that include temperature info; e.g:
```
shell$ orcmd
[AGGREGATOR-linux:96071] Sun Aug  3 23:40:00 2014: ORCM aggregator [[0,0],1] started
2014-08-03 23:40:05-0700,AGGREGATOR-linux,41.000000,39.000000,35.000000, ...
2014-08-03 23:40:10-0700,CN-linux-01,41.000000,40.000000,36.000000, ...
```

* Start ‘orcmd’ as a root daemon on the compute nodes.
On ORCM Compute Node 1:
```
shell$ orcmd
[CN-linux-01:26355] 
******************************
Mon Aug  4 00:35:04 2014: ORCM daemon [[0,0],2] started and connected to aggregator [[0,0],1]
My scheduler: [[0,0],0]

******************************
```

On ORCM Compute Node 2:
```
shell$ orcmd
[CN-linux-02:26355] 
******************************
Mon Aug  4 00:35:04 2014: ORCM daemon [[0,0],3] started and connected to aggregator [[0,0],1]

******************************
```

On ORCM Compute Node 3:
```
shell$ orcmd
[CN-linux-03:26355] 
******************************
Mon Aug  4 00:35:04 2014: ORCM daemon [[0,0],3] started and connected to aggregator [[0,0],1]

******************************
```
### SSH Environment Setup for CNs
<br>The ssh client and sshd needs to be setup to pass in the ORCM environment variables.

Here is an example using [pexec](https://github.com/hpc/pexec/archive/1.5-3.tar.gz):
```
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
  AcceptEnv OPAL_PREFIX OPAL_LIBDIR LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
vi /etc/ssh/ssh_config 
  SendEnv OPAL_PREFIX OPAL_LIBDIR LD_LIBRARY_PATH 

pexec -Ppm 'node[01-32]' --scp '/etc/ssh/sshd_config' %host%:/etc/ssh/.
pexec -Ppm 'node[01-32]' --ssh 'service sshd reload'
# Copy over the ORCM release
pexec -Ppm 'node[01-32]' --rsync '/opt/open-rcm' %host%:/opt/.

# After starting ORCM on HN, start on the CNs
pexec -Ppm 'node[01-32]' --ssh '/opt/open-rcm/0.5.0/bin/orcmd'
```
