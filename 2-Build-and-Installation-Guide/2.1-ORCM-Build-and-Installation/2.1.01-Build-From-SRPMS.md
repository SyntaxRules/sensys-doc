Note: See [[2.1.05-Build-Dependencies]] if you have not previously set up your system for running ORCM.

Download the source rpms and run 'rpmbuild' command to build binary rpms for your system. For example,

```
shell$ echo "%_topdir $HOME/rpmbuild" > $HOME/.rpmmacros # if you have not already setup a .rpmmacros
shell$ rpmbuild --rebuild open-rcm-<version>.src.rpm
```

This will create the following folder in users home directory
```
/home/<user>/rpmbuild
SRPM
RPM
BUILD
BUILDROOT
SPEC
```
Install the rpm:
```
shell$ cd /home/<user>/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/
shell$ sudo rpm -ivh open-rcm-<version>.rpm
```
This will install ORCM into
```
/opt/open-rcm/
```
You may want to set your path:
```
PATH=/opt/open-rcm/bin:$PATH:
export PATH
```
