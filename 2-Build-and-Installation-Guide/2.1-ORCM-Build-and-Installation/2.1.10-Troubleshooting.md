* Problems with Yum:

Note: Yum installation requires a privileged access.

Do you have an accessible yum repository? Check in /etc/yum.repos.d/rhel-source.repo: If the RedHat repos are unavailable, you can try to add an alternate, e.g:
```
[centos]
name=Centos
baseurl=http://vault.centos.org/6.4/os/x86_64/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
```

* Problems running orcmd: 
If you get an error such as the following after completing the build process (autogen - configure - make - make install):
```
shell$ orcmd
[chris-linux-01:11937] [[0,0],INVALID] ORTE_ERROR_LOG: Not found in file ../../../../orcm/mca/cfgi/base/cfgi_base_fns.c at line 764
```

Check that you have the correct orcm-site.xml in <install_folder>/usr/etc. The make install process overwrites this file with a default version.
