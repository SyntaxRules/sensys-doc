shell$ zypper install sigar sigar-devel

Or, if sigar and sigar-devel are not available from your package manager:

shell$ zypper install cmake
shell% wget http://vault.centos.org/6.5/os/Source/SPackages/sigar-1.6.5-0.4.git58097d9.el6.src.rpm
shell% rpm -ihv ./sigar-1.6.5-0.4.git58097d9.el6.src.rpm

####2.1.5.2 Dependencies for sensor framework IPMI component

IPMI Util – IPMI util library is a dependency for including IPMI plugin in the sensor framework.  IPMI Util libraries is for accessing Base board management controller (BMC) on compute nodes and for collecting OOB RAS monitoring data from the compute nodes. Aggregator node will need this installed for OOB access to the compute node BMC’s.

You can grab the 2.9.6 version here:
```
wget -nd --reject=*.html* --no-parent -r \
     http://ipmiutil.sourceforge.net/FILES/archive/ipmiutil-2.9.6-1.src.rpm
rpm -hiv ipmiutil-2.9.6-1.src.rpm
## The above step will install the ipmiutil source code and a spec file
## in a "rpmbuild" directory and store it in the home directory.

## Add the configure option "--enable-libsensors" to the configure command
## in the ipmiutil.spec file

rpmbuild -bb SPECS/ipmiutil.spec
rpm -ivh ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/ipmiutil-2.9.6-1.el6.x86_64.rpm
rpm -ivh ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/ipmiutil-devel-2.9.6-1.el6.x86_64.rpm
```

####2.1.5.3 Database Dependencies

The database is an optional component for logging RAS data.  At the moment, ORCM provides support for the PostgreSQL DBMS.  There are two options (components) for enabling database support:

* PostgreSQL native client library
* ODBC

To build ORCM with database support connecting via the PostgreSQL native client library, the following dependencies are required:

* PostgreSQL development package
* PostgreSQL client package (installed as a dependency of the development package)
* PostgreSQL shared libraries (installed as a dependency of the client package)

NOTE: PostgreSQL usually installs to its own directory, so when configuring ORCM make sure to specify the directory prefix for the include files and libraries via the "with-postgres" parameter (whether through the command line or the configuration file).

To build ORCM with database support connecting via the ODBC interface, the following dependencies are required:

* unixODBC development package
* unixODBC (installed as a dependency of the development package)
* PostgreSQL ODBC driver

Installation instructions for these components depends on the Linux distribution.  For detailed instructions for the PostgreSQL packages, please refer to: [PostgreSQL installation wiki](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides).

To download and install use:
yum localinstall http://yum.postgresql.org/9.3/redhat/rhel-6-x86_64/pgdg-centos93-9.3-1.noarch.rpm
For more information on unixODBC, please refer to: [unixODBC](http://www.unixodbc.org/).

For more details on the database installation itself, please refer to: [[2.2-Database-Installation]].
