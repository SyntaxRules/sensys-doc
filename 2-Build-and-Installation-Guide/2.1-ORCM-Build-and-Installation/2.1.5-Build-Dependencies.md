IPMI Util – IPMI util library is a dependency for including IPMI plugin in the sensor framework.  IPMI Util libraries is for accessing Base board management controller (BMC) on compute nodes and for collecting OOB RAS monitoring data from the compute nodes. Aggregator node will need this installed for OOB access to the compute node BMC’s.

Download the 2.9.3 release of IPMI Util library from here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/ipmiutil/files/ipmiutil-2.9.3.tar.gz
