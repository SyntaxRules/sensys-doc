Download the the source tar files gzip or bzip and use 'tar xf' to extract the files.  It is recommended to always specify a prefix when building.  Platform files can be used for managing sets of options for targets.
```
shell$ tar xvfz open-rcm-<version>.tar.gz or
shell$ tar xvfj open-rcm-<version>.tar.bz2
 
shell$ cd open-rcm-<version>
shell$ ./configure [--prefix <install_folder>] \
                   [--with-platform=<platform-file>]  
shell$ make all
```
Run as root to install the binaries if current user does not have write permissions to prefix directory
```
shell$ make install
```
By default the tar file based install will go into /usr/local/lib/ and /usr/local/bin/.  It is recommended to use --prefix /opt/open-rcm/&lt;version&gt; when running configure on tar file based installs.
