![ORCM RAS Monitoring - Initialization](2-Build-and-Installation-Guide/2.3-RAS-Monitoring/sensors-init.png)

Before sampling data using any of the underlying components, the framework and in effect each component has to be initialized. This is required for detecting the available plugins and verifying their underlying dependencies are met. Initialization stage also provides a safe state to allocate memory/space that's required for the component's functioning.

The base framework also detects the priority assigned for each component and selects the plugin with the highest priority in case of conflicting "component name". This step also calls the init functions of each component in effect instructing them to initialize their structures/memories and check for any particular dependencies. If anything is not in order and the init sequence fails, then the sensors framework removes the concerned plugin from it's 'bucket' list and in turn from sampling that particular metric(s).

The sensors framework's start call in turn sets up an event loop with a user defined time interval, with a specific callback function - "manually_sample", which gets invoked at after each trigger.
