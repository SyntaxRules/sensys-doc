Before sampling data using any of the underlying components, the framework and in effect each component has to be initialized. This is required for detecting the available plugins and verifying their underlying dependencies are met. Initialization stage also provides a safe state to allocate memory/space that's required for the component's functioning.

The base framework also detects the priority assigned for each component and selects the plugin with the highest priority in case of conflicting "component name"
