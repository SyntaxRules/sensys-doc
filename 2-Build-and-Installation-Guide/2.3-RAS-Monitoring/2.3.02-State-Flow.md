![ORCM RAS Monitoring - Initialization](2-Build-and-Installation-Guide/2.3-RAS-Monitoring/sensors-init.png)

Before sampling data using any of the underlying components, the framework and in effect each component has to be initialized. This is required for detecting the available plugins and verifying their underlying dependencies are met. Initialization stage also provides a safe state to allocate memory/space that's required for the component's functioning.

The base framework also detects the priority assigned for each component and selects the plugin with the highest priority in case of conflicting "component name". This step also calls the init functions of each component in effect instructing them to initialize their structures/memories and check for any particular dependencies. If anything is not in order and the init sequence fails, then the sensors framework removes the concerned plugin from it's 'bucket' list and in turn from sampling that particular metric(s).

The sensors framework's start call in turn sets up an event loop with a user defined time interval, with a specific callback function - "manually_sample", which gets invoked at after each trigger.

# Sensors Sample

The sampling stage of the sensors is pretty simple. The event loop (setup during the initialization stage) triggers after every sampling period and invokes the sample function of call of each active module. The order of selecting the sample function is based on the priority of each component and is assigned by the developer. Each components 'samples' their respective metrics and packs it into a large bucket, preceded with a string containing the plugin's name. The plugin with the lowest priority is the heartbeat plugin and it gets invoked the last. This is a special plugin in the sense that it it takes the packed buffer and sends it the aggregator, via the RML layer's send call by using a dedicated tag.

This state is valid only for the aggregator nodes, since the packed RAS metric data sent by the heartbeat plugin is 'always' directed at the aggregator node. Once the aggregator node received the buffer, it unpacks it and directs the contents to the log function of the respective component. This is possible since each component is expected to pack it's name preceding the metric contents.

# Sensors Stop & Finalize

Once the user application decides to stop sampling the metric data, it can invoke the finalize function call of the base framework which in turn removes the event from the event loop.

**NOTE: All the above explanation is valid for a single thread sampling. Per-thread sampling is slightly different from the above process. TBD**
