                   data_group varchar,
                   data_item varchar,
                   time_stamp varchar,

```

* Synopsis: records a data sample corresponding to metric data being collected for a node on the cluster, for example: system environmental data, performance data, power management states, etc.
* Notes:
    * The following records will be added if they don't already exist: host and data item.
* Parameters:
    * hostname*
    * data_group*: the name of the group this sample belongs to.  This allows grouping data items and avoiding name conflicts with data being collected by different ORCM components.
    * data_item*: the name of the data item that was collected.
    * time_stamp*: the time stamp at which the sample was collected.
    * value_num: the actual value of the sample when the sample is numeric.  Specify NULL for a string sample.
    * value_str: the actual value of the sample when the sample is of type string.  Specify NULL for a numeric sample.
    * units: the data units for the sample.  The units are optional.
* Returns: void.

set_node_feature(hostname varchar,
                 feature varchar,
                 value_num double precision,
                 value_str varchar,
                 units varchar)
```

* Synopsis: sets a particular feature for a given node, for example: number of sockets, cache, RAM, etc.  This is part of the inventory and it is useful for characterizing nodes (information that may be needed by the resource manager).
* Notes:
    * The following records will be added if they don't already exist: host and feature.
    * If the specified feature has not already been defined for the given node, it will be defined automatically.  Otherwise, it will simply be updated with the new value.
* Parameters:
    * hostname*
    * feature*: the name of the feature.
    * value_num: the actual value of the feature (if numeric).  Specify NULL if the feature is of type string.
    * value_str: the actual value of the feature (if it's of type string).  Specify NULL if the feature is numeric.
    * units: the data units for the value provided.  The units are optional.
* Returns: void.

```

* Parameters:
    * data_item*: the name of the data item.
    * data_type*: the data item type: 1 for numeric and 2 for string.
* Returns: integer: the ID of the newly added data item.
