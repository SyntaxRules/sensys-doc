####4.3.1.1 System Environmental Data

The relevant tables for storing system environmental data are:

* data_sample_raw
* data_sample
* data_item
* node

System environmental data is usually collected periodically at a set interval (or sample rate).  For efficiency, the _data_sample_raw_ table is meant to store this data.  If desired, the data can be stored in a normalized format in the _data_sample_, _data_item_ and _node_ tables (either directly or as part of post processing).  The _data_sample_ will contain the actual data that was collected, and this data will pertain to a node and a data item (e.g. core temperature, core frequency, etc.), hence the relationships.

####4.3.1.2 Inventory Data

The relevant tables for storing inventory data are:

* node
* node_feature
* feature

The _node_ table only contains very basic data about a node.  A more detailed description of a node can be obtained from the _node_feature_ table, as it is meant to store any features the node may have (e.g. number of cores, memory, processor speed, cache, etc.).

To keep track of FRU data and FRU changes, the following tables can be used:

* fru_type
* fru
* maintenance_record

At the moment, ORCM is not collecting FRU data, so these tables are not currently in use.

####4.3.1.3 Diagnostics Data

The relevant tables for storing diagnostics data are:

* diag: stores the different diagnostics that can be run on a node (composed of a diagnostic type and sub type)
* diag_type
* diag_subtype
* diag_test: stores an actual diagnostic run with its result
* test_result
* diag_test_config: stores details about the test parameters that were used for a diagnostics run

####4.3.1.4 Job Accounting Data

The relevant tables for job accounting are:

* job: stores job accounting data for each job
* job_node: stores the nodes that were assigned to each job

At the moment, ORCM is not collecting job accounting data, so the job accounting tables are not currently in use.

####4.3.1.5 Events

The relevant tables for storing events are:

* event
* event_type

At the moment, ORCM is not storing events to the database, so the event tables are not currently in use.
