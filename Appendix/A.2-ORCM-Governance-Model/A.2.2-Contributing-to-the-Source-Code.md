ORCM membership guidelines are the same as for OpenMPI.  The following are the types of membership:

* Members: have voting rights
* Contributors: collaborate with coding, testing and hosting services
* Partners: provide other services to OpenMPI

Individual contributors need to sign an individual license before contributing.  For more information, see: [Contributing to OpenMPI as an Individual](http://www.open-mpi.org/community/contribute/individual.php).

Alternatively, an organization can sign an organization-level agreement: [Contributing to OpenMPI as an Organization](http://www.open-mpi.org/community/contribute/corporate.php).

Note: OpenMPI membership is viewed as applying to the entire project (i.e. all software projects).  So it's not necessary to sign a different contribution agreement for OpenMPI vs. ORCM.  Of course, this doesn't mean that every contributor automatically gets write access to every software project.  For ORCM, the project gatekeeper is in charge of granting write access to the repo.
