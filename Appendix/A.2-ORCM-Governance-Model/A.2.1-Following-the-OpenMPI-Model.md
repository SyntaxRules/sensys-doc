The majority of open source projects are community maintained: the community drives implementation, fixes and releases.  Today, OpenMPI is a community maintained project and ORCM is derived from it (ORCM leverages about 2/3 of OpenMPI's source code).  The ORCM governance model is also derived from the OpenMPI's model.  More details about this governance model are provided in the following sections, but also please see:
