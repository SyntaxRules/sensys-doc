These are the instructions to generate the pdf from the Markdown wiki using docker.

1) Generate a docker image.

The Dockerfile (included in this folder) will be used by docker to create an image. This
image will have the pandoc and pdftk utilities inside. To generate this image run:

$ docker build -t wikigenerator .

Where wikigenerator is the label of this image.
This may take a while due to all the dependencies.

2) Check if the docker image was created.

Running 'docker images' should list the wikigenerator image.

3) Run the create_pdf.sh script into the docker image.

Go to root folder of this repository and run:

$ docker run -v `pwd`:/source wikigenerator "create_pdf.sh #.#.#"

Where #.#.# is the number of the release.
